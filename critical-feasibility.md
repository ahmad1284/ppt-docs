### **4.2 Revenue Model**  
| **Revenue Source**         | **Units** | **Monthly Price (USD)** | **Total Monthly Revenue (USD)** |
|----------------------------|----------:|------------------------:|--------------------------------:|
| Office Rooms               |       30  | 100                     | 3,000                           |
| Apartments                 |        8  | 500                     | 4,000                           |
| Multi-purpose Halls        |        2* | 400 (per booking)       | 1,600                           |

> *Multi-purpose hall revenue is based on two bookings per month.  

- **Annual Revenue:** **USD 112,800**

### **4.3 Profitability Analysis**  
- **Annual Net Profit:**  
  \[
  \text{Net Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Running Costs} = 112,800 - 39,000 = 73,800 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Return on Investment (ROI):**  
  \[
  ROI = \left(\frac{73,800}{2,200,000}\right) \times 100 \approx 3.35\%
  \]
- **Payback Period:**  
  \[
  \text{Payback Period} = \frac{2,200,000}{73,800} \approx 30 \, \text{years}
  \]
  With 3% annual growth, the period reduces to **21.62 years**.

### **4.4 Critical Observations**  
- **The ROI of 3.35% is low**, making the project unattractive to profit-driven investors.  
- **A 30-year payback period** is **too long** for an investment project.  
- If revenue growth or cost reductions are not achieved, the project may struggle to be financially sustainable.

## **5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation**  

### **5.1 Key Risks**  
- **Financial Risks:** Low profitability and long-term capital lock-in.  
- **Construction Risks:** Delays, budget overruns, and regulatory issues.  
- **Market Risks:** High dependency on occupancy rates and rental market fluctuations.  

### **5.2 Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Enhance Revenue Streams:** Increase rental prices or add premium services.  
- **Reduce Operational Costs:** Optimize management and reduce maintenance expenses.  
- **Partnerships & Funding Alternatives:** Secure co-investors or subsidies to lower financial burden.

## **6. Strategic Considerations**  

- **Critical Question:** Does this project provide enough return on investment to justify funding?  
- **Alternative Approaches:**  
  - Optimize financial structure to improve ROI.  
  - Consider mixed-use revenue models, such as co-working spaces or service-based rentals.  
  - Reassess if non-financial benefits (community growth, branding) can justify lower returns.

## **7. Conclusion & Recommendations**  

### **7.1 Conclusion**  
- The financial viability of the project is **weak** from a traditional investment perspective.  
- **Without revenue growth or cost reduction, returns remain low, and payback is too long.**  
- **Investors may find alternative projects with higher returns more attractive.**  

### **7.2 Recommendations**  
1. **Improve Financial Metrics:**  
   - Increase rental rates, introduce new revenue streams, or reduce operational costs.  
2. **Mitigate Financial Risks:**  
   - Secure co-investment or donor partnerships to spread financial risk.  
3. **Consider Alternative Projects:**  
   - If investment-focused, seek projects with better ROI and shorter payback periods.  
4. **Strategic Decision Needed:**  
   - Either **revise the financial model** for better returns or **reposition the project** for strategic, non-financial benefits.
