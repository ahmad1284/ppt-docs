> *Assumes two bookings per month for multi-purpose halls.

The annual revenue is thus **USD 112,800**.

### Profitability Analysis

- **Net Profit Calculation:**

  \[
  \text{Net Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Running Costs} = 112,800 - 39,000 = 73,800 \, \text{USD}
  \]
- **Return on Investment (ROI):**

  \[
  ROI = \left(\frac{73,800}{2,200,000}\right) \times 100 \approx 3.35\%
  \]
- **Payback Period:**

  \[
  \text{Payback Period} = \frac{2,200,000}{73,800} \approx 30 \, \text{years}
  \]

  With an assumed annual revenue growth of 3%, the payback period reduces to approximately **21.62 years**.

Despite the positive cash flow, the low ROI and extended payback period remain critical challenges. Enhancing revenue through premium services, diversifying income streams, or reducing operating costs is vital to improve these financial metrics.

## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

Several risks could impact the project's success:

- **Market & Economic Risks:** Variability in tenant demand and intensified competition could affect occupancy rates. Mitigation measures include conducting regular market studies and offering flexible lease agreements.
- **Construction & Operational Risks:** Potential delays and cost overruns necessitate the engagement of experienced contractors and a phased construction approach with milestone reviews.
- **Regulatory Risks:** Ongoing monitoring of local legislative changes is essential to maintain compliance.

Additional strategies involve diversifying the tenant mix, establishing contingency funds for unforeseen cost escalations, and maintaining robust stakeholder engagement to ensure the project aligns with local community needs.

## 10. Strategic Considerations

The analysis compares immediate financial returns with broader, non-monetary benefits. Although the project offers a positive net cash flow, the low ROI and long payback period present significant obstacles. Alternative strategies have been considered, including boosting revenue through premium offerings or mixed-use elements (e.g., co-working spaces) and forming strategic partnerships to share risk. Furthermore, non-monetary benefits—such as enhanced community development and improved local brand identity—are critical for the project’s long-term success and sustainability.

## 11. Conclusion

The **financial viability** of the project is *weak* from a traditional investment perspective. Without revenue growth or cost reduction, **returns remain low**, and the **payback period is too long**. Investors may find **alternative projects with higher returns** more attractive.

## 12. Recommendations

1. **Improve Financial Metrics:**
   - *Increase rental rates*, introduce new revenue streams, or reduce operational costs.
2. **Mitigate Financial Risks:**
   - Secure co-investment or donor partnerships to spread financial risk.
3. **Consider Alternative Projects:**
   - If investment-focused, seek projects with **better ROI** and **shorter payback periods**.
4. **Strategic Decision Needed:**
   - Either revise the financial model for better returns or reposition the project for **strategic, non-financial benefits**.
