# Feasibility Study for Commercial Complex Development

## 1. Executive Summary

This feasibility study evaluates the viability of developing a commercial complex, encompassing office spaces, apartments, multi-purpose halls, and a terrace with a penthouse. The project requires an initial investment of **USD 2,200,000**, with annual operating (running) costs of **USD 39,000** and expected annual revenues of **USD 112,800**. Our analysis indicates a positive net cash flow of approximately **USD 73,800 per year**. Despite a relatively long payback period—approximately **29.8 years** under current conditions (reduced to **21.62 years** with a 3% annual revenue growth)—the project is financially feasible, with potential for improvement through operational efficiency and strategic partnerships.

- **Return on Investment (ROI):**\[
  ROI = \left(\frac{73,800}{2,200,000}\right) \times 100 \approx 3.35\%
  \]
- **Payback Period:**
  \[
  \text{Payback Period} = \frac{2,200,000}{73,800} \approx 29.8 \, \text{years}
  \]
  With an assumed annual revenue growth rate of 3%, the payback period can be reduced to approximately **21.62 years**.
